# Shapeless-Study

A basic study project that runs through the API and is a cookbook of 
various recipes that can be done with the shapeless project. There are many examples
taken from documentation.  There are some original examples here as well.

All examples are done with *scalatest*. To run the examples:

```test:compile```

Then run a specific test, eg.

```testOnly com.xyzcorp.HListTest```

Or in execution mode

```~testOnly com.xyzcorp.HListTest```
